This dataset shows when each vaccine was introduced for the first time worldwide.
- For each, I've tried to track down the year, with a citation.
- I've also listed the name of the inventor when they were mentioned incidentally, but several are missing.

It also shows new versions of each vaccine were made available.
- For flu vaccines, for example, this refers to new platforms (e.g. a live attenuated vaccine vs. a protein vaccine, or a pandemic flu vaccine).
- The list of new versions is likely incomplete, and it was harder to track down the exact years for several historical ones.

The script turns the dataset into a chart on R.

If you'd like to add to this dataset, get in touch :)
