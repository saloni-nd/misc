This dataset shows when each vaccine was introduced for humans, for the first time.
- For each, I've tried to track down the year, with a citation.
- I've also listed the name of the inventor when they were mentioned incidentally, but several are missing.

It also shows new versions of each vaccine were made available.
- For HPV vaccines, for example, Gardasil and Gardasil-9 are both shown.
- For flu vaccines, 'new versions' refers to new platforms (e.g. a live attenuated vaccine vs. a protein vaccine, or a pandemic flu vaccine).
- The list of new versions hopefully covers most of them but is likely incomplete, and it was harder to track down the exact years for several historical ones.

The script turns the dataset into a chart on R.
