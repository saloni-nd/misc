This folder contains data on vaccination schedules in different countries and how they have changed over time.

Data comes from the World Health Organization (2025), which you can find here `https://immunizationdata.who.int/global?topic=&location=` under 'Introduction of _ vaccine'

The scripts turn the data into heatmaps to show how the vaccination schedule has changed for a particular country.
